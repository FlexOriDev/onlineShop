## How to install the project

Firstly, you will need an web development environment like [WampServer](https://www.wampserver.com/) or [Xamp](https://www.apachefriends.org/fr/index.html).

After that, you will need to setup the database. The config file is in **/bdd/pw.sql**.
Make sure to import this file in your database and it would be fine.

Final task : In the file **"database.php"** which is in **/actions/database.php**, you need to change the username and password on the third line.

That's it ! Enjoy the project ! :)

## Structure
